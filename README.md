# Connect-Four-Xtreme

A connect four program implemented using JavaScript and HTML.

This code is an enhancement of Connect-Four and runs exactly like the standard game, except it's "Xtreme" :

  Xtreme Connect Four:
  Instead of the dimensions of the board being a standard 7x6, the dimensions are 10x10
  Instead of having two players (red and yellow) there is an additional third player (green)
