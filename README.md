# Connect-Four-Xtreme

A connect four program implemented using JavaScript and HTML.

This code is an enhancement of Connect-Four and runs exactly like the standard game, except it's "Xtreme" :

    Xtreme Connect Four:
    
    Instead of the dimensions of the board being a standard 7x6, the dimensions are 10x10
    Instead of having two players (red and yellow) there is an additional third player (green)
    The game continues to run untill a winner has been declared, or untill a stalemate has been reached
    
    Enhancements :
    
    Three players added instead of two
    Board extended to 10x10 instead of 7x6
    Added golden outline around the four winning chips
    Added the spacebar as an event listener which resets the board whenever the user wants to
